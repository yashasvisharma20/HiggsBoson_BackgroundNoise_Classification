# Higgs Boson Background Noise Classification using Random Forest

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying background noise in Higgs Boson detection using the Random Forest algorithm. The Higgs Boson particle, discovered at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), requires precise data analysis to distinguish real particle signals from noise. This project aims to improve classification accuracy using a machine learning-based approach.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the [Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson). It consists of simulated collision data with features representing physics properties of detected particles. The goal is to classify events as either signal (Higgs Boson present) or background noise.

### Features:
- The dataset contains multiple numerical features corresponding to detected particle properties.
- Some features include missing values, requiring preprocessing.

### Target Variable:
- `signal`: Represents events where Higgs Boson is detected.
- `background`: Represents events caused by other physics processes.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection and engineering
   - Standardization/Normalization
   
2. **Model Training**
   - Implementing Random Forest classifier
   
3. **Evaluation**
   - Performance metrics
     
4. **Results & Visualization**
   - Feature importance analysis
  
   
## Installation & Usage
